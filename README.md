## Xenium Prime 5k Experiment Data Analysis

This repository houses a series of Jupyter notebooks developed for the comprehensive analysis of Xenium Prime 5k experimental data. Each notebook in this project addresses a specific stage of the analysis pipelineâ€”from converting raw data into efficient formats to performing advanced downstream analyses. The goal is to streamline the workflow and provide clarity at every step of the process.

### Notebook 1: Xenium to Zarr Conversion Notebook

- **Purpose:**  
  This notebook converts all the Xenium datasets into the Zarr format. The Zarr format offers a condensed version of the spatial dataset that is optimal for efficiently loading `SpatialData` objects during analysis.

- **Key Functions and Processes:**  
  - **Input/Output:**  
    - **Input:** Xenium dataset directory.  
    - **Output:** A Zarr file storing the converted data.
  - **Steps Involved:**  
    1. **Dataset Reading:** Loads the Xenium dataset using the `spatialdata_io.xenium` function.
    2. **Directory Management:** Checks if the target Zarr directory exists and removes it if necessary.
    3. **Data Conversion:** Writes the loaded `SpatialData` object to the specified Zarr file.
    4. **Iteration:** Loops through directories in the input path to process multiple datasets by dynamically generating output file paths.

### Notebook 2: Feature and Localization Analysis

- **Purpose:**  
  These notebooks demonstrate how to use the `SpatialData` and `Bento` packages to analyze spatial transcriptomics data from the Xenium dataset. They focus on calculating key shape and transcript features, as well as performing localization analysis.

- **Key Components and Analysis:**  
  - **Load Data:**  
    - Loads a Xenium dataset from a pre-converted Zarr file into a `SpatialData` object.
    - Prepares the data for downstream analysis with Bento.
  - **Shape and Point Features:**  
    - Computes metrics such as soma and nuclear area, aspect ratio, and transcript density to assess data quality and cellular morphology.
  - **Localization Analysis:**  
    - Classifies gene transcripts into distinct localization patterns (Cell Edge, Cytoplasmic, Nuclear, Nuclear Edge, and None) using the RNAForest model.
    - Visualizes these patterns with an UpSet plot and a radar plot to compare gene-specific localization strengths.

### Notebook 3: Synaptic Immunofluorescence Alignment

- **Purpose:**  
  These notebooks align Xenium imaging data to synaptic immunofluorescence (IF) images. The objective is to align DAPI, presynaptic, and postsynaptic images using transformation matrices, crop the data to the region-of-interest, and visualize the quality of the alignment.

- **Key Components and Analysis:**  
  - **Create SpatialData Object:**  
    - Loads a SpatialData object from a pre-converted Zarr file that contains imaging and morphological data.
  - **Align Images:**  
    - Uses an alignment matrix to transform and parse the DAPI, presynaptic, and postsynaptic IF images into `Image2DModel` objects.
  - **Visualization:**  
    - Overlays the DAPI image with aligned IF images to verify correct registration.
  - **ROI Cropping:**  
    - Determines the region-of-interest using bounding box calculations and crops the SpatialData object accordingly.
  - **Saving Results:**  
    - The processed SpatialData object is saved as a new Zarr file for downstream analysis.

- **Notebook Location:** [Coronal 1 Cortex: Synaptic Immunofluorescence Alignment Notebook](./analysis/Dylan/alignment/coronal1_cortex_alignment.ipynb)

- **Yeo group**:
  - Use `module load scverse/1.0.0_spatialdata0.2.6`

### Notebook 4: Synaptic Compartment Analysis

- **Purpose:**  
  These notebooks perform an in-depth analysis of transcripts in multiple subcellular compartments. They focus on segmenting immunofluorescence images to extract presynaptic and postsynaptic regions, mapping transcript points to these compartments, and calculating quantitative metrics.

- **Key Components and Analysis:**  
  - **Data Loading:**  
    - Loads an aligned SpatialData object from a pre-converted Zarr file containing IF imaging data.
  - **Utility Functions:**  
    - Defines custom plotting functions to render images and transcript point scatterplots.
  - **Segmentation:**  
    - Implements segmentation of the presynaptic and postsynaptic regions using preprocessing steps (gamma adjustment, Gaussian filtering, erosion) followed by multi-Otsu thresholding.
  - **Labeling and Mapping:**  
    - Converts segmentation outputs into label elements.
    - Extracts pixel coordinates and maps transcript points (both unassigned and soma-inclusive) to synaptic compartments.
  - **Counts Calculation:**  
    - Computes transcript counts across different compartments (e.g., exclusive presynaptic, postsynaptic, overlapping areas, nucleus, and soma) and calculates derived metrics by excluding synaptic signals.
    - Saves the calculated counts to a CSV file for downstream analysis.
  - **Visualization:**  
    - Provides extensive visualizations including raw IF images, segmentation overlays, combined segmentation masks, and gene-specific transcript plots (e.g., for Dlg4) with scale bars and integrated visual elements.

### Notebook 5: Bento QC

- **Purpose:**  
  These notebooks use bento to perform basic QC plotting (eg. cell size, localization etc.)
